things to keep in mind:

- trees have a non-constant ramification factor because the set of instructions have different numbers of parameters;
additionally, some nodes like While or If are meta-constructs that get translated automatically to more nodes

- haha its funny because i was actually picking the worst individual in each tournament

- the problem structure greatly influences the performance of the genetic algorithm

- maybe add a "For" or "Repeat" node that repeats x times?
